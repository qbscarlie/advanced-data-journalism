I'm Carlie Procell and I'm a junior studying data journalism at Mizzou. I'm also getting minors in my two other loves - computer science and Latin. I'm originally from Louisiana, but I've also lived in Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia. I'm taking this class mostly because I want to extend my knowledge of Python in a journalism context. I've only used Python before in a programming/web development context and not ever to scrape data from a website, so I'm very excited to learn more! I'm also interested in strengthening my data analysis skills so I can write better data-centric stories.
